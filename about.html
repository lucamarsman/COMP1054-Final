            <section>
               <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
               <p>Roy and Ryan Seiders founded YETI in 2006 based on a deep love for the outdoors and the belief that if something doesn't work, fix it.
               And if it doesn't exist, build it. Since then, we've been designing products that last for generations, get you out into the Wild, and keep you there longer. 
               Here's our story:</p>
               <br>

               <h3>INNOVATION BORN OUT OF FRUSTRATION</h3>
               <p>The coolers Roy and Ryan grew up with couldn't meet the demands of serious anglers or last in the relentless Texas heat. So they made their own - designing the legendary Tundra® with enough insulation to keep ice for days and durability to last a lifetime.</p>
               <br>

               <h3>BUILT FOR THE WILD</h3>
               <p>We've expanded into other products and categories since those first coolers, but our bull-simple approach to design hasn't changed. Focus on quality. Design for durability.
               Never cut corners on form or function. It's the same philosophy we've used to make drinkware, soft coolers, chairs, bags, cargo and more. Built for the Wild™ means it's built to last.</p>
               <br>

               <h3>A COMMUNITY OF COMMUNITIES</h3>
               <p>From hog hunts to happy hours and the backcountry to back stage, our products have been embraced by communities and outdoor pros across the world all connected through a single common thread - that the gear you rely on should never let you down.</p>
               <br>

               <h3>KEEP THE WILD, WILD</h3>
               <p>YETI was founded on a simple desire to spend more time in the wild. And with more time spent outside, the more we understand our responsibility to protect the places we love. Learn more about how we're actively working towards our key commitments to our people, products, and places.</p>
